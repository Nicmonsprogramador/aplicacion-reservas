Reservation Application
General Architecture
Frontend: React

Objective: Provide an interactive user interface to manage reservations.
Components: Pages and components for creating, modifying, viewing, and canceling reservations.
State Management: Manage global state (using Context API, Redux, etc.) to share data between components.
Communication: Use fetch or axios for making API calls to the backend.
Backend: Java (Spring Boot)

Objective: Handle client application requests and perform CRUD operations on the database.
Components: Controllers, Services, and Repositories.
REST API: Expose endpoints to create, read, update, and delete reservations.
Security: Implement authentication and authorization.
Database: MongoDB

Objective: Store reservation data, user information, and potentially other related data (tables, rooms, etc.).
Data Model: Schemas for reservations, users, and other relevant entities.
Implementation Details
Frontend: React

Project Setup

Initialize a project with Create React App.
Install necessary dependencies: react-router-dom for routing, axios for HTTP requests, etc.
Component Structure

App.js: Main container with routes.
Components: ReservationList, CreateReservation, EditReservation, ReservationDetail, etc.
State Management

Use useState and useEffect for local state and side effects.
Consider using Context API or Redux for global state management if the application grows in complexity.
Communication with Backend

Use axios or fetch to make requests to backend APIs.
Example request to get reservations:
javascript
Copiar c贸digo
axios.get('http://localhost:8080/api/reservations')
  .then(response => setReservations(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching reservations:', error));
Backend: Java with Spring Boot

Project Setup

Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE.
Include dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, and Spring Security (if necessary).
Class Structure

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and respond with JSON data.
Services: Contain business logic.
Repositories: Interact with MongoDB.
REST API

Example of a controller for handling reservations:
java
Copiar c贸digo
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/reservations")
public class ReservationController {

    @Autowired
    private ReservationService reservationService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Reservation> getAllReservations() {
        return reservationService.findAll();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Reservation createReservation(@RequestBody Reservation reservation) {
        return reservationService.save(reservation);
    }

    // Other endpoints for update, delete, etc.
}
Data Model

Example of a reservation entity:
java
Copiar c贸digo
@Document(collection = "reservations")
public class Reservation {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String customerName;
    private Date reservationDate;
    private int numberOfPeople;
    // Getters and Setters
}
MongoDB Connection

Configure the connection to MongoDB in application.properties or application.yml:
properties
Copiar c贸digo
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/reservationdb
Database: MongoDB

Data Model

Define schemas for collections like reservations, users, etc.
Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud instance or a local installation.
Data Structure

Each reservation might include fields like customerName, reservationDate, numberOfPeople, etc.
Deployment and Security
Deployment

Frontend: Deploy the React application using Vercel, Netlify, or any other static hosting service.
Backend: Deploy the Java Spring Boot service on Heroku, AWS, or any other cloud provider.
Security

Implement authentication and authorization if the application requires it, using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions.
Secure the connection between frontend and backend using HTTPS.
